        question: "What is a data structure?",
        answer: "A data structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used effectively."
    },
    {
        id: 2,
        question: "What is an algorithm?",
        answer: "An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure or formula for solving a problem."
    },
    {
        id: 3,
        question: "What is a stack?",
        answer: "A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle."

        id: 4,
        question: "What is a queue?",
        answer: "A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle."
    },
    {
        id: 5,
        question: "What is a linked list?",
        answer: "A linked list is a linear data structure where each element is a separate object, known as a node, and each node contains a reference to the next node in the sequence."
    },
    {
        id: 6,
        question: "What is a binary tree?",
        answer: "A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child."
    },
    {
        id: 7,
        question: "What is a hash table?",
        answer: "A hash table is a data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values."
    },
    {
        id: 8,
        question: "What is a graph?",
        answer: "A graph is a data structure that consists of a finite set of nodes (or vertices) and a set of edges connecting these nodes."
    },
    {
        id: 9,
        question: "What is dynamic programming?",
        answer: "Dynamic programming is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems and solving each of these subproblems just once, and storing their solutions."
    },
    {
        id: 10,
        question: "What is a recursive algorithm?",
        answer: "A recursive algorithm is one that solves a problem by solving smaller instances of the same problem."
